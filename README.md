# Data incubator Project: News-Detector
 separate true news from fake news


Are ready to pitch your project by explaining your analysis and what you hope to do. We are especially impressed with strong existing work and analysis.
Keep working on your projects, and make sure you can present more than what you were able to complete during the challenge.
Have a compelling intro. Who is the project useful for? How will it help them? Why should others find it interesting?
Have memorable takeaways. These should show how your project solves a problem, technical accomplishments, and interesting aspects of the data.
Be specific. Tell us about how much data you analyzed, the tools and techniques you used, and any other information that will set your work apart.
Be concise. You only get 2â€“3 minutes to convince the panel. Make sure you've got your presentation as succinct as possible.
Be prepared. Don't read off a script. Practice your presentation in front of a mirror, your mom, your roommate, your cat.
Be natural. We want to get a sense of the real you, so take a deep breath and remember that, while you may work with a lot of machines and computers, you're still human.
